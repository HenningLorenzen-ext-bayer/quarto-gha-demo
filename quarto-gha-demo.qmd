## Quarto

-   Following a walk-through loosely based on <https://jadeyryan.com/blog/2023-11-19_publish-quarto-website/>

-   Instead of `usethis::use_git()`, I have at first committed the boilerplate
    Quarto project (as generated by the RStudio project wizard) locally and then
    pushed things to GitHub with:

```{r, eval=FALSE}
usethis::use_github()
```
